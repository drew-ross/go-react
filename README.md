# The game of Go in React + TypeScript

This is an implementation of the game of Go in React and TypeScript. I made this project to improve my skills as a developer and because I personally enjoy the game. For more information about the game and rules, see
[the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

## Setup

The project uses the default [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) scripts.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
